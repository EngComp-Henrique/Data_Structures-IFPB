## Prerequisite

Before starting, you have to install:

* [GCC Compiler (Compiling C code)](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)

* [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* [CMake (Control software compilation)](https://cmake.org/download/)

## How to run?

After you've installed all the tools, you're ready to run the code

### Running python code

* Access the folder with the python code and run:

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

### Running C code
